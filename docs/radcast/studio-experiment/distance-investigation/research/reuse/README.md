# **<span style="color:#76b900;">🤫 RE-USE: Multilingual Universal Speech Enhancement</span>**
# Model Overview


## Description
In universal speech enhancement, the goal is to restore the **quality** of diverse degraded speech while preserving **fidelity**, ensuring that all other factors remain unchanged, e.g., linguistic content, speaker identity, emotion, accent, and other paralinguistic attributes. Inspired by the **distortion–perception trade-off theory**, our proposed single model achieves a good balance between these two objectives and has the following desirable properties:

- Robustness to **diverse degradations**, including additive noise, reverberation, clipping, bandwidth limitation, codec artifacts, packet loss and low-quality mics .
- Support for **multiple input sampling rates**, including 8, 16, 22.05, 24, 32, 44.1, and 48 kHz.
- Strong **language-agnostic** capability, enabling effective performance across different languages.

This model is for research and development only.

## Usage
Directly try our [**Gradio Interactive Demo**](https://huggingface.co/spaces/nvidia/RE-USE) by uploading your noisy audio/video !!

## Environment Setup
1. (For **Mamba** setup)Pre-built Docker environments can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/RoyChao19477/SEMamba?tab=readme-ov-file#-docker-support) to simplify **Mamba** setup.

2. If you need bandwidth extension:

```bash
pip install resampy 
```
3. Download and navigate to the HuggingFace repository:
```
huggingface-cli download nvidia/RE-USE --local-dir ./REUSE --local-dir-use-symlinks False
cd ./REUSE
```

## Inference
Follow the simple steps below to generate enhanced speech using our model:
1. Place your noisy speech files in the folder `noisy_audio/`
2. Run the following command:
```bash
sh inference.sh
```
3. The enhanced speech files will be saved in `enhanced_audio/`.

That's all !

**Note:**

a. You can enable bandwidth extension by setting the target bandwidth using the `BWE argument` in the script.

---

If your noisy speech files are **long and may cause GPU out-of-memory (OOM)** errors, please use the following procedure instead:
1. Place your long noisy speech files in the folder `long_noisy_audio/`
2. Run the following command:
```bash
sh inference_chunk.sh
```
3. The enhanced speech files will be saved in `Long_enhanced_audio/`.

**Note:**

a. You can enable bandwidth extension by setting the target bandwidth using the `BWE argument` in the script.

b. You can also configure the `chunk_size_in_seconds` and `hop_length_portion` directly in the script.

Our AI models are designed and/or optimized to run on NVIDIA GPU-accelerated systems. By leveraging NVIDIA’s hardware (e.g. GPU cores) and software frameworks (e.g., CUDA libraries), the model achieves faster training and inference times compared to CPU-only solutions.

## Software Integration
**Runtime Engine(s):**
* Not Applicable (N/A)

**Supported Hardware Microarchitecture Compatibility:**
* NVIDIA Ampere (A100)

**Preferred Operating System(s):**
* Linux

The integration of foundation and fine-tuned models into AI systems requires additional testing using use-case-specific data to ensure safe and effective deployment. Following the V-model methodology, iterative testing and validation at both unit and system levels are essential to mitigate risks, meet technical and functional requirements, and ensure compliance with safety and ethical standards before deployment.
